            Born in the island of the Philippines, I came to America with my family when I was 16 years old.
            I attended San Diego City College and my degree was Computer Information Systems. While in college,
            I was a volunteer student teacher who helped tutor my classmate in Java and always gets Dean Invitation as
            an honor student. However, I always decline the offer because in my mind back then; I do not need recognition
            as long as I am doing what I like. When the recession came, the final subject that I need to take was
            suddenly gut cut off and was not offered anywhere. So instead of wasting my time just waiting and doing
            nothing. I decided to find a job to keep my self busy. However, finding a job was not that easy. It takes me
            years to find any lead. But I never think of giving up, I keep moving forward.
          </p>

            Fast forward, an opportunity came knocking in my door. A job opening for a position of Pharmacy Technician was open,
            in the place were my Mom works. So I took that opportunity and work my hardest to prove myself that I am fit for the role.
            Three years had pass and I thought I lost my interest in computer programming. When suddenly I saw Origin Code Academy
            infomercial. It's about a model who went to code school with zero experience and became successful. So I decided to quit my job
            and became a full-time student.

            Outside of coding, I enjoy working out, playing video games (like World of Warcraft), collecting PS1 to PS4 JRPG games,
            and boxing. If you were curious why working out? It's because back in 2017 I weigh around 215 lbs, but through hard work
            and dedication. I am now around 150 lbs and I feel more happy, energetic and healthier. If you want to see my before
            and after picture. Here is the link to my instagram post. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BoR2TEqA8r5/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet" target="_blank"><span>[Click Here]</span></a>
            Why do I think I am fit a good fit to your company? If given a chance, I will be the hardest-worker you will ever see. I'm a team player,
            have a good work ethic, discipline, realibility, creative, competitive nature, never give up attitude and positivity.
